## Project Details

### Tech Stack:
React with Redux

### Description:
The project tries to imitate LinkedIn website. Salient features include a login screen and the main screen that appears after a user has successfully logged in. The feed in the main screen is dynamic and user generated. To create a post, all a user has to do is type in what is on their mind in the text field at the top of the field, and hit enter. The post gets displayed instantly on top of the feed. To log out, simply press the 'Me' button next to the notifications icon at the top right.

The project uses Firebase as its backend and employs the Firestore Database (for storage of posts), Authentication (for user authentication) and Cloud Hosting (to host the website).
